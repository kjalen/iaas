The date you're submitting this. 
### Location of deployed application 
If applicable, please provide the url where we can find and interact with your running application. 
### Time spent 
 - Auth took me about 3 hours
 - db integration took me about 3 hours to get working (never worked with mongo)
 - setting up all the endpoints, getting them to work they way i want, about 5 hours
 - tests, 2 hours. I've used Cypress before but with very different workflows
### Assumptions made 
I imagined this would be used to provide primary keys for database records, but manually. I imagined a beleaguered dba inputting rows one by one into several tables and needing them to have primary keys. This application would benefit from a front end, and I would of liked to make a front end, but I decided I could not fit it in the scope.
